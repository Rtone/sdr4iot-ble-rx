# ble_dump - SDR Bluetooth LE dumper

This repository is a fork of [sdr4iot-ble-rx](https://github.com/Rtone/sdr4iot-ble-rx) proposed in 2021 by [Rtone](https://github.com/Rtone).

> **The original project used a message sink block, which cannot be used that way in the new version of GNU Radio (3.10.5.1). Therefore, I will use ZMQ block instead to make the project operational again.**

> The operating environment of the original project: `Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS` + `GNU Radio Companion 3.7.11`


# Introduction
This tool was created to dump Bluetooth LE (BLE) packets using SDR hardware. The captured BLE packets can either be saved to a PCAP file or displayed directly in Wireshark via a named pipe (FIFO). Gnu Radio is used to receive and demodulate the incoming BLE packets. The received packet bytes are transferred to ble_dump using a common Gnu Radio Message Sink.

# Gnu Radio flow-graph
The following (simplified) Gnu Radio Companion (GRC) signal flow graph is used to generate the final flow-graph source code:

# SDR hardware
Your SDR device should offer a minimum sample rate of 4.000.000 samples/sec. The SDR device as well should be usable as Gnu Radio osmocom/osmosdr source device. The HackRF One SDR was used for all Gnu Radio related tasks described within this document. Other SDRs should also work well.

# Usage
Scan BLE advisory channels (37, 38, 39) and save received packets to PCAP file:

```
./ble_dump.py -o /tmp/dump1.pcap
```

Scan BLE advisory channels (37, 38, 39) and send received packets to FIFO:

```
mkfifo /tmp/fifo1
./ble_dump.py -o /tmp/fifo1
```
Display BLE packets from FIFO in Wireshark:

```
wireshark -S -k -i /tmp/fifo1
```

# Extensions
# Differencies from initial version
 
* Calculate the start/end indexes of IQ BLE data into the global IQ data 
* Record timestamped robot positions into a csv file  
* Record  BLE packet information ['Timestamp','Start_trame','End_trame','Channel frequency','Sample_rate'] into a csv file
* Use a linear interpolation method for robot position estimation for a detected packet
* Tag the IQ BLE data by using the  estimaded robot positions 
* Extract IQ BLE data from the global IQ data by using the csv file and the whole IQ data file
* Save the extracted IQ BLE data and useful information (Start_Frame, Sample count, Central Frequency, Sample rate, robot positions X & Y) into a descriptive format(sigmf)
```sh
# install sigmf via pip
pip install sigmf
```

# Notes
* The captured BLE packets are stored as "Bluetooth Low Energy Link Layer" (btle) format
* BLE Data and BLE Control packets are currently not supported
* If the default hopping pattern is used, and you want to receive BLE data it should be possible to hop only a limited number of BLE data channels. Keep in mind that the initial CRC value (not 0x555555) is essential to determine the validity of incoming BLE data packets.
* Feel free to help and improve the code!

~~The generated Gnu Radio Companion (GRC) signal flow graph (grc/gr_ble.py) was slightly modified to avoid errors. If you re-generate the GRC flow graph please run to following command-line:~~(No longer needed)

```
sed -i -e "s/message_sink_msgq_out,/message_queue,/" -e "s/message_sink_msgq_out = virtual_sink_msgq_in/self.message_queue = message_queue/" ./grc/gr_ble.py
```
